<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>jNetPcap is a java wrapper around Libpcap and WinPcap native
libraries found on various unix and windows platforms. jNetPcap exposes
the functionality as a java programming interface (API) which this
documentation describes.
<p><b> Feature highlights:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Follows native <em>Libpcap</em> programming model. This makes
	learning <em>jNetPcap</em> API easy.</li>
	<li><b> No packet buffer copies between Libpcap and java
	space. </b>Existing native in-memory buffer is wrapped inside a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>
	object.</li>
	<li>Low level and efficient JNI implementation.</li>
	<li>Provides some very low level functions previously not
	available in Java space. i.e. <code>setBuffer</code> for changing
	buffer size and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project website and the native <em>Libpcap</em> connection</h2>

<p>Since <em>jNetPcap</em> is very closely mapped to native <em>Libpcap</em>
library functions, users are encouraged to read libpcap documentation at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpcap">libpcap website</a>
(former http://tcpdump.org). You can visit <em>jNetPcap</em> project
website for for more information and a user guide with tutorials at <a
	href="http://jnetpcap.sf.net">http://jnetpcap.sf.net</a> .</p>
<h1>About Libpcap native library</h1>
<p>Pcap is an application programming interface for packet
capturing. The implementation of pcap for Unix-like systems is known as
libpcap; the Windows port of libpcap is called WinPcap. libpcap and
WinPcap may be used by a program to capture packets travelling over a
network and, in newer versions, to transmit packets on a network at the
link layer, as well as to get a list of network interfaces that can be
used with libpcap or WinPcap. libpcap and WinPcap are the packet capture
and filtering engines of many open source and commercial network tools,
including protocol analyzers, network monitors, network intrusion
detection systems, packet sniffers, traffic generators and network
testers. The pcap API is designed for use from C and C++, so, for other
languages such as scripting languages, Java, and .NET languages, a
wrapper is generally used. (<em>Credit: wikipedia.org</em>)</p>
<h1>About WinPcap windows libpcap implementation</h1>
WinPcap WinPcap consists of:
<ul>
	<li>drivers for Windows 95/98/Me, and for the Windows NT family
	(Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows
	Vista, etc.), that use NDIS to read packets directly from a network
	adapter
	<li>implementations of a lower-level library for those OSes, to
	communicate with those drivers
	<li>a port of libpcap that uses the API offered by the low-level
	library implementations. It was originally created at the Politecnico
	di Torino. Now it's maintained by CACE Technologies, a company created
	by some of the WinPcap developers.

<h1>About jNetPcap a java wrapper</h1>
<b>jNetPcap</b>
is a java wrapper based on both libpcap and WinPcap. jNetPcap's API
provides core implementation based on unix libpcap API library (
<code>org.jnetpcap</code>
) while also providing the WinPcap extra functionality as an extension (
<code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap</code>
). The main classes which implement libpcap and WinPcap functinality
are:
<ul>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.Pcap</code> class - core libpcap methods
	available on all platforms</li>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap.WinPcap</code> class - extensions
	based on WinPcap library typically only available on windows based
	system</li>
</ul>
The core libpcap implementation of jNetPcap, provides methods to do the
following functions
<ul>
	<li>Find a complete list of network interfaces the system has</li>
	<li>open either a network interface or a PCAP capture file for
	reading packets</li>
	<li>apply a packet filter</li>
	<li>dump packets into a PCAP capture file</li>
	<li>transmit raw link layer packets over a network interface</li>
	<li>gather statistics on network interface counters</li>
</ul>

<h1>About jNetPcap's WinPcap extension</h1>
WinPcap library from (
<a href="http://winpcap.org">http://winpcap.org</a>), provides support for all of the core libpcap functions. It also
provides numerous functions that are not part of the core libpcap
functionality and are only available on platforms that support WinPcap.
These extra functions greatly enhance libpcap calls, and generally don't
provide features not found in the core. They simply provide enhanced
versions of the functions that are more efficient or provide greater
control over lets say the behaviour of the NPF driver within a windows
kernel. This is great news for windows platforms.
<h2>Checking for WinPcap extension support</h2>
Since java can be run on nearly any platform and WinPcap extensions are
only available on windows platforms, the user must check first if the
extension is available before using it. The check is done using a static
method call
<code>WinPcap.isSupported</code>
which will return a boolean value. Returned value of
<code>true</code>
means that the extension is supported otherwise
<code>false</code>
. WinPcap extension can not be used on a platform that does not support
the extension. Any method used with
<code>WinPcap</code>
on an unsupported platform, will throw an immediate
<code>PcapExtensionNotAvailableException</code>
, to indicate that its more then just this one particular operation that
is disabled. Therefore it is very important to always do a check first
before relying on an extension.

<h1>Other extensions?</h1>
Currently no other extensions are supported, but can easily be added
once suitable candidates are found such as (AirPcap from
http://cacetech.com), as long licensing terms permit it.
<h2>Java requirements</h2>
<em>jNetPcap</em>
Requires Java JRE 1.5. It also requires the binary WinPcap package to be
installed on the system (downloadable from
<a href="http://winpcap.org">WinPcap website</a>
.) jUnit tests are distributed in source form found in the
<em>tests/java</em>
directory. No compiled classes are supplied of jUnit tests with the
binary release. Any
<a href="junit.org">jUnit library</a>
is sufficient to compile and run all jUnit test cases. Build environment
requires ANT, ANT's contrib
<a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net">cpptasks</a>
, and a C++ compiler. Currently jNetPcap compiles using
<a href="http://mingw.org">MinGW</a>
gcc compiler and environment on win32 platform and under regular gnu gcc
on linux. No
<em>Makefiles</em>
are used nor required.
