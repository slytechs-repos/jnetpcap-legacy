== Release 1.1 (2008-06-19) ==

* Maintenance release

* Provides packages for: Fedora Core 8 (Linux), Debian 4 (Linux), Win32 (WinXP/Vista)

* NO BUG FIXES - no bugs reported from the time of previous release
                                 
== Release 1.0 (2007-12-21) ==

* First production release

* Bug #1855589 - Win32 isInjectSupported returned incorrect value 

== Release 1.0b4 (2007-08-21) ==

* Linux support

* Bug #1776380 - PcapBpfProgram exceptions on linux platform

* Added

  - Pcap.inject, Pcap.isSendPacketSupported, Pcap.isInjectPacketSupported,
    Pcap.lookupDev, Pcap.lookupNet
                                 
== Release 1.0b3 ==

* No bugs found or reported since previous release

* Additions to org.jnetpcap package
  
  - All core 'libpcap' functions
    
  - PcapClosedException, PcapExtensionNotAvailableException exceptions

* Addtions of and to jnetpcap.org.winpcap package - WinPcap extensions
  
    + Nearly all WinPcap based functions, very few exceptions

* Removed "commons-logging" dependency. Static initializers throw appropriate 
  exceptions directly during initialization failure.

== Release 1.0b2 ==

* Bug #1767744  - PcapHandler object ptr error in loop() and dispatch()
                  This is a critical bug, where PcapHandler objects clobers the
                  parent Pcap object data after invocation through loop() or
                  dispatch() method.
                 
* Add a number of int constants to Pcap.java class to represent various return
  codes, flags, and mode settings. Each constant has detailed explanation of
  its usage and where it is be applicable.
  
* openLive() method will now also return "warning" messages in errbuf, even if
  result code from the OK was 0, meaning no error had occured, as per pcap 
  specification.
  
* Possible issue uncovered, but not fixed in this release.

  - setting the snaplen value on openLinve() call does not seem to cause a 
    return of a truncated packet buffer from next(), nextEx(), dispatch() or 
    loop(). The buffer always contains the entire packet. Significant
    debugging effort does not point to a bug in jNetPcap software but in
    underlying WinPcap library. This could be in issue with particular Network
    Interface Card in use. The issue is still under investigation, but the fix 
    to critical bug #1767744 can not be delayed.
    
== Release 1.0b1 ==

* Initial release
