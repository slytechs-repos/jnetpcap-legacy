<h1>Test package for bug#1848562 cannot see ICMP packets</h1>
<h2>cannot see ICMP packets</h2> 
I am running the 'Classic example' from your website on a windows machine
(A). Its connected to another machine (B) which is also a windows machine.
When i ping A from B i do not see any packets in the display. I also get a
similar problem for TCP Syn packets - that is machine B sends a TCP Syn
packet to machine A but machine A does not see the packet.

I am using the code in the attached file on machine A.

Thanks
Paul
