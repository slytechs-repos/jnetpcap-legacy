/**
 * The IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure is specific to network adapters with IPv4
 * enabled. The IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure contains the number of network
 * adapters with IPv4 enabled on the local system and an array of
 * IP_ADAPTER_INDEX_MAP structures with information on each network adapter with
 * IPv4 enabled. The IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure contains at least one
 * IP_ADAPTER_INDEX_MAP structure even if the NumAdapters member of the
 * IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure indicates that no network adapters with IPv4 are
 * enabled. When the NumAdapters member of the IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure is
 * zero, the value of the members of the single IP_ADAPTER_INDEX_MAP structure
 * returned in the IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure is undefined. The
 * IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure can't be used to return information about the
 * loopback interface. On Windows Vista and later, the Name member of the
 * IP_ADAPTER_INDEX_MAP structure in the IP_INTERFACE_INFO structure may be a
 * Unicode string of the GUID for the network interface (the string begins with
 * the '{' character). This structure is defined in the Ipexport.h header file
 * which is automatically included in the Iphlpapi.h header file. The Ipexport.h
 * header file should never be used directly. Examples
 * 
 * <pre>
 * typedef struct _IP_INTERFACE_INFO {  
 * 	LONG NumAdapters;  
 * 	IP_ADAPTER_INDEX_MAP Adapter[1];
 * } IP_INTERFACE_INFO,  *PIP_INTERFACE_INFO;
 * </pre>
