/**
 * A special buffer that also allows java object references to be set within the

 * buffer will keep track of them, to be released when this buffer is released.
 * References are setup to work at JMemory level and will be transfered to other
 * objects if a peer or transfer method is used.
 * <p>
 * JObjectBuffer does not keep track of which reference is set at which memory
 * location within this buffer. Therefore it is impossible to release a
 * individual JNI global reference.
