/**
 * A header scanner, there is one per header, that is able to scan raw memory
 * buffer and determine the length of the header and the next header ID after
 * examining the current header's structure. The header scanner is bound to the
 * native direct scanner provided by the jNetPcap native implementation. The
 * header scanner can be overriden with a java implementation by simply
 * subclassing it and overriding the <code>getHeaderLength</code> and
 * <code>getNextHeader</code> methods. If either of the 2 types of methods are
 * overriden, then the user should also overriden the {@link #isDirect()} method
 * and return false to indicate that this is not a native direct scanner.
 * <p>
 * The header scanner is natively peered directly with the appropriate function
 * that performs the scan and determines the next protocol in chain of headers
 * found in the data buffer. Another words this class is peered using a function
 * pointer and dispatched appropriately when invoked to scan for length or next
 * header id.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is a typedef definition and the function pointer signature.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * typedef void (*native_protocol_func_t)(scan_t *scan);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <b>Note</b> that scan_t structure is implemented by java class JScan which
 * is peered with that structure.
 * </p>
