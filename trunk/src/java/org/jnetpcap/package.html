<p><em>jNetPCAP</em> is a complete and comprehensive Java wrapper
around the popular libpcap and winpcap from tcpdump.org folks. jNetPCAP
uses Java JNI (Java Native Interface) extensions that are platform
specific to give access to libpcap functionality from java programs. The
goal of jNetPCAP was to stick as close as possible to the actual libpcap
API so that another API did not have to be learned. Thus its fairely
easy to pickup with jNetPCAP and use it right away if you are familiar
with existing "C" counter part libpcap and winpcap libraries.</p>

<p>This document describes the usage, implementation details and few
differences between jNetPCAP and back end libpcap implementations. Java
is after all OOPL (Object Oriented Programming Language).</p>
<p>
<b> Feature highlights:</b>
<ul>
<li> Follows native <em>Libpcap</em> programming model. This makes learning <em>jNetPcap</em> API
easy. </li>
<li> <b> No packet buffer copies between Libpcap and java space. </b>Existing native
in-memory buffer is wrapped inside a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code> object.</li>
<li> Low level and efficient JNI implementation.</li>
<li> Provides some very low level functions previously not available in Java space.
i.e. <code>setBuffer</code> for changing buffer size and others.</li>
<li> Very small library footprint</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project website and the native <em>Libpcap</em> connection</h2>

<p>Since <em>jNetPcap</em> is very closely mapped to native <em>Libpcap</em>
library functions, users are encouraged to read libpcap documentation at
<a href="http://tcpdump.org">tcpdump.org</a>. You can visit <em>jNetPcap</em>
project website for for more information and a user guide with tutorials
at <a href="http://jnetpcap.sf.net">http://jnetpcap.sf.net</a> .</p>

<h2>Getting Started!</h2>
<p>The starting point for <em>jNetPcap</em> is the <a
	href="Pcap.html">Pcap class</a></b>. The <code>Pcap</code> class works
directly with the native <em>Libpcap</em> by peering through the use of
a native library and Java's JNI API. The class contains several static
methods that create capture sessions at which point a dynamic session
reference is returned. From then on, all operations are done through the
dynamic <code>Pcap</code> methods. There are other static methods that
have more global affect, such as tuning kernel buffer sizes, compiling
filter expressions offline, etc.</p>
<p>Primary purpose of a capture session is to capture network
packets. There are 3 main methods provided by <code>Pcap</code> class.
They are <code>openLive</code>, <code>openOffline</code> and <code>openDead</code>.
<code>openLive</code> captures packets from a live network interface. <code>openOffline</code>
reads packets from a file, and <code>openDead</code> is used to create a
dummy pcap session for use with certain functions.</p>
<p>Once you have either an open live or offline session, you can
capture packets using either a dispatch model, or read one packet at a
time method. Methods <code>dispatch</code> and <code>loop</code> allow
the user to register a packet handler to which all packets will be
dispatched. Methods <code>next</code> and <code>nextEx</code> return one
packet at a time.</p>
<p>Pcap library also provides an efficient filtering mechanism that
works at the kernel level and even hardware level in certain cases,
where a text expression is used to construct a binary filter that can be
applied to capture sessions. The methods <code>compile</code>, <code>compileNoPcap</code>
and <code>setFilter</code> are used to compile and activate filters.</p>
<h2>Decoding packets</h2>
<p>The native <em>Libpcap</em>, on which <em>jNetPcap</em> is based
on, does not provide facilities to decode packet contents. The users of
the native library are expected to utilize existing system C structures
to decode the content themselves. Libpcap only returns pointers to
buffers that contain the data and some information about the packet,
mainly amount of data captured and detailed timestamp of when the packet
was captured.</p>


<h3>Decoding packets manually</h3>
<em>jNetPcap</em>
library does not offer any decoding services by itself, just like native
Libpcap. For basic things you can do some manual decoding of the raw
packet buffers obtained from a capture. You know what the first protocol
header within the buffer is using
<code>Pcap.datalink()</code>
instance method call.
<code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>
provides a a number of getter methods for accessing ints, shorts and
other types of java primitives. Here is a short example of how to
capture a single packet, make sure its an ethernet packet, and decode a
single field within the ethernet header.
<pre>
StringBuilder errbuf = new StringBuilder();
String file = "capturefile.pcap";
PcapPktHdr hdr = new PcapPktHdr(); // Capture header, filled in at capture

Pcap pcap = Pcap.openOffline(file, errbuf);
if (pcap == null ) { return; }
ByteBuffer buffer = pcap.next(hdr);
if (buffer == null) { return; }

pcap.close(); // We're done capturing, only needed 1 packet

int dlt = pcap.datalink(); // First header type.
if (dlt == Pcap.EN10MB) {
	int protocol = buffer.getShort(12); // Get a 16-bit short, at 12th byte in
	
	// convert from signed short, to unsigned short and store in an integer
	protocol = (protocol &lt; 0)?protocol + Short.MAX_VALUE * 2 : protocol;
	
	// 
	System.out.printf("The value of Ethernet.protocol field is=0x%X\n", protocol);
}
</pre>

Using the manual approach only works for simple tasks and protocols. The
complexity of protocol interactions are complex and not well handled
manually. A better approach is to use decoder library to do the manual
work for us.

<h3>Decoding packets with jNetStream</h3>
<p>OpenSource <a href="http://jnetstream.sf.net">jNetStream</a> is a
higher layer API, built upon <em>jNetPcap</em> library and provides very
comprehesive decoding and and encoding facilities. <em>jNetStream</em>
comes with a rich library of protocols. It also hides all of the low
level details of <em>jNetPcap</em> API. Users work with higher level
Capture sessions. Both <em>jNetPcap</em> and <em>jNetStream</em> were
written by same author.</p>
<p>jNetStream is fusion of Ethereal/Wireshark and NetDude for
capture file manipulation. Utilizes the latest advances in Java
technology, to provide comparable level of performance to its C counter
parts.</p>
<p>Here is a small code example how to decode a packet using <em>jNetStream</em>
library.
<pre>
StringBuilder errbuf = new StringBuilder();
String file = "capturefile.pcap";
PcapPktHdr hdr = new PcapPktHdr(); // Capture header, filled in at capture

Pcap pcap = Pcap.openOffline(file, errbuf);
if (pcap == null ) { return; }
ByteBuffer buffer = pcap.next(hdr);
if (buffer == null) { return; }

pcap.close(); // We're done capturing, only needed 1 packet

long seconds = hdr.getSeconds();
int nanosecs = hdr.getUSeconds() * 1000; // Convert from micro to nano
int snaplen = hdr.getCaplen();
int length = hdr.getLen();
int dlt = pcap.datalink(); // First header type.
</pre>
Upto this point, we haven't used any jNetStream code. Now jNetStream
library steps in.
<pre>
ProtocolID id = PcapDlt.valueOf(dlt); // In org.jnetstream.capture.file.pcap pkg

Packet packet = Packets.newPacket(buffer, dlt, snaplen, length, seconds, nanosecs);

// Now we can work with a decoded packet
if (packet.hasHeader(Ip.class)) {
	Ip ip = packet.get(Ip.class);
	
	System.out.println("IP.version = %\n", ip.version());
	System.out.printf("%s -> %s\n", ip.source().toString(), ip.destination().toString());
}
// and so on...
</pre>

Since jNetStream is already layered ontop of jNetPcap, we could have
saved ourselves a bunch of trouble. Here is the same example using only
jNetStream API:
<pre>
String file = "capturefile.pcap";
for (Packet packet: Captures.openFile(file)) {
	if (packet.hasHeader(Ip.class)) {
		Ip ip = packet.get(Ip.class);
		
		System.out.println("IP.version = %\n", ip.version());
		System.out.printf("%s -> %s\n", ip.source().toString(), ip.destination().toString());
	}
	break; // We just wanted 1 packet
}
Captures.close();
</pre>

<h2>Loading the native library</h2>
The jNetPcap project is made up of 2 parts. The first part is the Java
API described in this documentation along with Java class files. The
second part is a native dynamically loaded C library, named
<em>jnetpcap</em>
. The library is loaded once when any of the jNetPcap class files are
referenced. The
<code>Pcap</code>
class automatically requests to load the appropriate library for the
native platform and initializes it.

<h3>UnsatisfiedLinkError when accessing any of the native java
methods</h3>
<p>If you get this exception thrown when accessing or intializing
Pcap library, it means that it did not load the native shared library,
and corresponding JNI methods, are unlinked. Java VM <em>DOES NOT
USE CLASSPATH</em> to load native libraries. Therefore it is not enough to
have the library or just the jar file in classpath.</p>
Java supports the following command line option to determine the
location of a native library
<code>-Djava.library.path=</code>
to which you can assign a relative or absolute path where the library is
stored. All implementations also look for libraries in the java
extension point, which is in the
<code>$JAVA_HOME/ext</code>
directory.

<h3>Library loading procedure on win32 systems</h3>
In addition, on windows systems, Java looks in the
<code>\windows</code>
and
<code>\windows\system32</code>
directories. Windows also uses the familiar
<code>PATH</code>
environment variable to search for library. Just like when its looking
for an executable. So just add the directory to the PATH variable. Here
is how you would do it from the DOS
<code>cmd</code>
. (Note, to get
<code>cmd</code>
on WinXP or WinVista go to
<code>Start -> Run</code>
and type
<code>cmd</code>
. A cmd window should open up.) Lets assume that the library resides in
<code>c:\jnetpcap\lib</code>
directory.
<pre>
C:\> PATH=%PATH%;c:\jnetpcap\lib
c:\> 
</pre>
In IDE's you would add the environment variable to the "launch" profile
or build properties. But of course, setting the
<code>-Djava.library.path=</code>
on Java VM command line is the prefered way.
<br>
(i.e.
<code> c:\> java -Djava.library.path=c:\jnetpcap\lib -jar
myJNetPcapApp.jar</code>
)

<h3>Library loading procedure on unix based systems</h3>
On all unix systems the typical
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environmental variable is to search for the library.

<h3>Name of the native library</h3>
The name of jNetPcap's native library is
<b>jnetpcap</b>
all lower case letters. When placing a call to
<code>System.loadLibrary</code>
do not specify any suffixes, postfixes or extensions. This holds true
for all operating systems. Further information can be found in JavaDoc
API documentation for
<code>System.loadLibrary</code>
.
