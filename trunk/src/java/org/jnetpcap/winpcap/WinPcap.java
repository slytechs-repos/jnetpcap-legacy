/**
 * WinPcap specific extensions to libpcap library. To access WinPcap extensions,
 * you must use WinPcap class and its methods. <code>WinPcap</code> class
 * extends Pcap class so you have all of the typeical <code>Pcap</code> class
 * functionality. WinPcap provides many additional methods which are only
 * available on platforms what support WinPcap. First you must use static
 * <code>WinPcap.isSupported()</code> method call which will return a boolean
 * that will indicate if WinPcap extensions are supported on this particular
 * platform. If you try and use any method in this class when WinPcap extensions
 * are not supported, another words <code>WinPcap.isSupport()</code> returned
 * false, every method in this calls will throw
 * <code>UnsupportOperationException</code>.

	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Open a live capture associated with the specified network interface device.
	 * pcap_open_live() is used to obtain a packet capture descriptor to look at
	 * packets on the network. device is a string that specifies the network
	 * device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device
	 * argument of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from all
	 * interfaces. snaplen specifies the maximum number of bytes to capture. If
	 * this value is less than the size of a packet that is captured, only the
	 * first snaplen bytes of that packet will be captured and provided as packet
	 * data. A value of 65535 should be sufficient, on most if not all networks,
	 * to capture all the data available from the packet. promisc specifies if the
	 * interface is to be put into promiscuous mode. (Note that even if this
	 * parameter is false, the interface could well be in promiscuous mode for
	 * some other reason.)
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * For now, this doesn't work on the "any" device; if an argument of "any" or
	 * NULL is supplied, the promisc flag is ignored. to_ms specifies the read
	 * timeout in milliseconds. The read timeout is used to arrange that the read
	 * not necessarily return immediately when a packet is seen, but that it wait
	 * for some amount of time to allow more packets to arrive and to read
	 * multiple packets from the OS kernel in one operation. Not all platforms
	 * support a read timeout; on platforms that don't, the read timeout is
	 * ignored. A zero value for to_ms, on platforms that support a read timeout,
	 * will cause a read to wait forever to allow enough packets to arrive, with
	 * no timeout. errbuf is used to return error or warning text. It will be set
	 * to error text when pcap_open_live() fails and returns NULL. errbuf may also
	 * be set to warning text when pcap_open_live() succeds; to detect this case
	 * the caller should store a zero-length string in errbuf before calling
	 * pcap_open_live() and display the warning to the user if errbuf is no longer
	 * a zero-length string.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Special note about <code>snaplen</code> argument.</b> The behaviour
	 * of this argument may be suprizing to some. The <code>argument</code> is
	 * only applied when there is a filter set using <code>setFilter</code>
	 * method after the <code>openLive</code> call. Otherwise snaplen, even non
	 * zero is ignored. This is the behavior of all BSD systems utilizing BPF and
	 * WinPcap. This may change in the future, but that is the current behavior.
	 * (For more detailed explanation and discussion please see jNetPcap website
	 * and its FAQs.)
