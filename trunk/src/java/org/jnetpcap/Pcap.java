/**
 * <P>
 * This class is the main class peered with native <code>pcap_t</code>
 * structure in libpcap and winpcap library impelementations. It provides a
 * direct mapping of various library methods from Java.
 * </P>
 * <h2>Getting started</h2>
 * <p>
 * <code>Pcap</code> class provides several static methods which allow
 * discovery of networking interfaces and then subsequently open up either
 * <code>openLive</code>, <code>openDead</code> or <code>openOffline</code>
 * pcap capture sessions. In all 3 cases a <code>Pcap</code> object is
 * returned. The object is backed by a C <code>pcap_t</code> structure outside
 * of java VM address space. Any non-static operations on the <code>Pcap</code>
 * object, are translated using java JNI API into corresponding Libpcap C calls
 * and the appropriate <code>pcap_t</code> C structure is supplied to complete
 * the call.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After aquiring a <code>Pcap</code> object from above mentioned static
 * methods, you must call on {@link #close} call to release any Libpcap
 * resources and the backing C structure. The <code>Pcap</code> object does
 * implicitly call the {@link #close} method from its {@link #finalize} method,
 * but that will only happen when the <code>Pcap</code> is garabage collected.
 * Its best practice to remember to always call on {@link #close} when
 * <code>Pcap</code> object and capture session is no longer needed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If <code>Pcap</code> object is closed and any of its non-static methods are
 * called on, after the close, {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Getting a list of network interfaces from Pcap</h3>
 * Lets get started with little example on how to inquire about available
 * interfaces, ask the user to pick one of those interfaces for us, open it for
 * capture, compile and install a capture filter and then start processing some
 * packets captured as a result. This is all loosely based on examples you will
 * find on tcpdump.org website but updated for jNetPCAP. As with libpcap, we
 * first want to find out and get network interface names so we can tell
 * jNetPCAP to open one or more for reading. So first we inquire about the list
 * of interfaces on the system:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * StringBuilder errbuf = new StringBuilder();
 * List&lt;PcapIf&gt; ifs = new ArrayList&lt;PcapIf&gt;(); // Will hold list of devices
 * int statusCode = Pcap.findAllDevs(ifs, errbuf);
 * if (statusCode != Pcap.OK) {
 * 	System.out.println(&quot;Error occured: &quot; + errbuf.toString());
 * 	return;
 * }
 * // We have a list of PcapIf devices to work with now.
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> the return value from {@link #findAllDevs} is an integer result
 * code, just like in the C counter part. The <code>ifs</code> list is filled
 * in with all the network devices as found from the corresponding C structure
 * <code>pcap_if</code> linked list returned from the C function call
 * findAllDevs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Now that we have a list of devices, we we print out the list of them and ask
 * the user to pick one to open for capture:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; ifs.size(); i++) {
 * 	System.out.println(&quot;#&quot; + i + &quot;: &quot; + ifs.get(i).getName());
 * }
 * 
 * String l = System.in.readline().trim();
 * Integer i = Integer.valueOf(l);
 * 
 * PcapIf netInterface = ifs.get(i);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Opening a network interface for live capture</h3>
 * Next we open up a live capture from the network interface using
 * {@link #openLive(String, int, int, int, StringBuilder)}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * int snalen = 2048; // Truncate packet at this size
 * 
 * int promiscous = Pcap.MODE_PROMISCUOUS;
 * 
 * int timeout = 60 * 1000; // In milliseconds
 * 
 * Pcap pcap = Pcap.openLive(netInterface.getName(), snaplen, promiscous, timeout,
 *     errbuf);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Last argument is a buffer that will hold an error string, if error occures.
 * On error <code>openLive</code> will return null.
 * <h3>Compiling and applying a filter to network interface</h3>
 * Once we have an open interface for capture we can apply a filter to reduce
 * amount of packets captured to something that is interesting to us:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PcapBpfProgram filter = new PcapBpfProgram();
 * String expression = &quot;port 23&quot;
 * int optimize = 0; // 1 means true, 0 means false
 * int netmask = 0;
 * 
 * int r = pcap.compile(filter, expression, optimize, netmask);
 * if (r != Pcap.OK) {
 *   System.out.println(&quot;Filter error: &quot; + pcap.getErr());
 * }
 * pcap.setFilter(filter);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If filter expression contained a syntax error, the return code will be -1 and
 * exact error message can be retrieved using {@link #getErr} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note of caution:</b> the <code>PcapBpfProgram</code> at the top of the
 * previous code section, can not be accessed until successfully filled in with
 * values in the <code>pcap.compile</code> code. If you try and access any of
 * its methods an <code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown. Only
 * after a successful call to <code>compile</code> does the object become
 * usable. The object is peered with C structure and until properly intialized,
 * can not be accessed from java.
 * </p>
 * <h3> Dispatcher to receive packets as they arrive</h3>
 * And lastly lets do something with the data.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * PcapHandler handler = new PcapHandler() {
 * 
 * 	public void newPacket(Object userData, int caplen, int len, int seconds,
 * 	    int usecs, ByteBuffer buffer) {
 * 
 * 		PrintStream out = (PrintStream) userData;
 * 		out.println(&quot;Packet captured on: &quot; + new Date(seconds * 1000).toString());
 * 	}
 * };
 * 
 * int cnt = 10; // Capture packet count
 * PrintStream out = System.out; // Our custom object to send into the handler
 * 
 * pcap.loop(cnt, handler, out); // Each packet will be dispatched to the handler
 * 
 * pcap.close();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This sets up PCAP to capture 10 packets and notify our handler of each packet
 * as each one is captured. Then after 10 packets the loop exits and we call
 * pcap.close() to free up all the resources and we can safely throw away our
 * pcap object. Also you may be curious why we pass System.out as userData to
 * the loop handler. This is simply to demonstrate the typical usage for this
 * kind of parameter. In our case we could easily pass a different PrintStream
 * bound to lets say a network socket and our handler would produce output to
 * it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Alternative way of capturing packets from any of the open pcap sessions is to
 * use {@link #dispatch(int, PcapHandler, Object)} method, which works very
 * similarly to {@link #loop(int, PcapHandler, Object)}. You can also use
 * {@link #next(PcapPktHdr)} and {@link #nextEx(PcapPktHdr, PcapPktBuffer)}
 * methods which will deliver 1 packet at a time.
 * </p>
 * <h3>No packet data copies!</h3>
 * <p>
 * The packet data is delivered in a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>. The
 * data is not copied into the buffer, but a direct byte buffer is allocated and
 * wrapped around the packet data as returned from libpcap. No in memory copies
 * are performed, so if the native operating system supports no-copy packet
 * captures, the packet are delived to Java without copies. Only a single
 * ByteBuffer object allocation is incured.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Omitted methods from standard lipcap API</h3>
 * Certain deprecated methods from libpcap API have been omitted such as
 * <code>lookupDev</code>, <code>lookupNet</code>. Also any methods that
 * return <code>FILE *</code> since that is not appropriate for java
 * environment.
