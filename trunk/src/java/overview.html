<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>jNetPcap is a java wrapper around Libpcap and WinPcap native
libraries found on various unix and windows platforms. jNetPcap exposes
the functionality as a java programming interface (API) which this
documentation describes.
<p><b> Feature highlights:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Follows native <em>Libpcap</em> programming model. This makes
	learning <em>jNetPcap</em> API easy.</li>
	<li><b> No packet buffer copies between Libpcap and java
	space. </b>Existing native in-memory buffer is wrapped inside a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>
	object with not data copies.</li>
	<li>Low level and efficient JNI implementation.</li>
	<li>Provides some very low level functions previously not
	available in Java space. i.e. <code>setBuffer</code> for changing
	buffer size on windows platform and others.</li>
</ul>
The API follows the C libpcap counter part very closely in order to
expose all of the functionality and even quirks of libpcap. For example
old style integer status codes are returned and warning/error messages
are filled into a java
<code>StringBuilder</code>
buffer and no java exceptions are thrown outside the usual
mismatched/invalid arguments.

<h2>Project website and the native <em>Libpcap</em> connection</h2>

<p>Since <em>jNetPcap</em> is very closely mapped to native <em>Libpcap</em>
library functions, users are encouraged to read libpcap documentation at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump">libpcap on wikipedia</a>
and visit libpcap's homepage at <a href="http://tcpdump.org">http://tcpdump.org</a>.
You can also visit <em>jNetPcap</em> project website for more
information and a user guide with tutorials at <a

<h1>About Libpcap native library</h1>
<p>Pcap (which stands for <u>P</u>acket <u>Cap</u>ture) is an
application programming interface for packet capturing from a live
network interface. The implementation of pcap for Unix-like systems is
known as libpcap; the Windows port of libpcap is called WinPcap. libpcap
and WinPcap may be used by a program to capture packets traveling over
a network and, in newer versions, to transmit packets on a network at
the link layer, as well as to get a list of network interfaces that can
be used with libpcap or WinPcap. libpcap and WinPcap are the packet
capture and filtering engines of many open source and commercial network
tools, including protocol analyzers, network monitors, network intrusion
detection systems, packet sniffers, traffic generators and network
testers. The pcap API is designed for use from C and C++, so, for other
languages such as scripting languages, Java, and .NET languages, a
wrapper is generally used. (<em>Credit: wikipedia.org</em>)</p>
<h1>About WinPcap windows libpcap implementation</h1>
WinPcap WinPcap consists of:
<ul>
	<li>drivers for Windows 95/98/Me, and for the Windows NT family
	(Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows
	Vista, etc.), that use NDIS to read packets directly from a network
	adapter
	<li>implementations of a lower-level library for those OSes, to
	communicate with those drivers
	<li>a port of libpcap that uses the API offered by the low-level
	library implementations. It was originally created at the Politecnico
	di Torino. Now it's maintained by CACE Technologies, a company created
	by some of the WinPcap developers.

<h1>About jNetPcap a java wrapper</h1>
<b>jNetPcap</b>
is a java wrapper based on both libpcap and WinPcap. jNetPcap's API
provides core implementation based on unix libpcap API library (
<code>org.jnetpcap</code>
) while also providing the WinPcap extra functionality as an extension (
<code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap</code>
). The main classes which implement libpcap and WinPcap functionality
are:
<ul>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.Pcap</code> class - core libpcap methods
	available on all platforms</li>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap.WinPcap</code> class - extensions
	based on WinPcap library typically only available on windows based
	system</li>
</ul>
The core libpcap implementation of jNetPcap, provides methods to do the
following functions
<ul>
	<li>Find a complete list of network interfaces the system has</li>
	<li>Open either a network interface or a PCAP capture file for
	reading packets</li>
	<li>Apply a packet filter</li>
	<li>Dump packets into a PCAP capture file</li>
	<li>Transmit raw link layer packets over a network interface</li>
	<li>Gather statistics on network interface and report counters</li>
</ul>

<h1>About jNetPcap's WinPcap extension</h1>
WinPcap library from
<a href="http://winpcap.org">http://winpcap.org</a>
, provides support for all of the core libpcap functions as well as,
numerous functions that are not part of the core libpcap functionality
and are only available on platforms that support WinPcap. These extra
functions greatly enhance libpcap calls, and generally don't provide
features not found in the core. They simply provide enhanced versions of
the functions that are more efficient or provide greater control over
lets say the behavior of the NPF driver within a windows kernel. This
is great news for windows platforms.
<h2>Checking for WinPcap extension support</h2>
Since java can be run on nearly any platform and WinPcap extensions are
only available on certain platforms (i.e. windows based platforms), the
user must check first if the extension is available before using it. The
check is done using a static method call
<code>WinPcap.isSupported</code>
which will return a boolean value. Returned value of
<code>true</code>
means that the extension is supported otherwise
<code>false</code>
. WinPcap extension can not be used on a platform that does not support
the extension. Any method used with
<code>WinPcap</code>
on an unsupported platform, will throw an immediate unchecked
<code>PcapExtensionNotAvailableException</code>
, to indicate that this extension is not available on this particular
platform. Therefore, it is very important to always do a check first
before relying on an extension function (i.e. org.jnetpcap.winpcap.)

<h1>Other extensions?</h1>
<p>Currently no other extensions are supported, but can easily be
added once suitable candidates are found such as AirPcap from <a
	href="http://cacetech.com">http://cacetech.com</a> , as long licensing
terms permit it.</p>
<small>Note: currently there are no plans to support AirPcap as
an extension. The name was arbitrarily chosen as an example of another
libpcap extension.</small>
<h1>Java requirements</h1>
<em>jNetPcap</em>
requires at minimum Java JRE 1.5 for runtime support and JDK 1.5 for
development. It also requires the binary libpcap, libpcap-dev or WinPcap
packages to be installed, as appropriate for each platform, on any given
system (downloadable from
<a href="http://winpcap.org">WinPcap website</a>
or appropriate package repository for unix systems.) jUnit tests are
distributed in source form found in the
<em>tests/java</em>
directory. No compiled classes are currently supplied of jUnit tests
with the binary release. Any
<a href="junit.org">jUnit library</a>
is sufficient to compile and run all jUnit test cases. Build environment
requires ANT, ANT's contrib
<a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net">cpptasks</a>
, and a C++ compiler. Currently jNetPcap compiles using
<a href="http://mingw.org">MinGW</a>
gcc compiler and environment on win32 platform and under regular gnu
gcc/g++ on linux. No
<em>Makefiles</em>
are used nor required.
<h1>Other java Pcap wrappers</h1>
<p>Here is a little introduction to other java wrappers (unrelated
to jNetPcap), in order to clear up the confusion between various like
sounding projects (this includes this one) in relation to a java wrapper
for native libpcap. The jNetPcap is completely independent project from
all other java libpcap wrappers. The names of the projects may sound
similar but the implementation and goals of each project were much
different.</p>
<p>Two non related projects that jNetPcap team is aware of are both
named the same <b>jPcap</b> and they both provide two different APIs and
implementations. Please see each projects for more detail:
<ul>
	<li>jPcap on SourceForge: <a href="http://jpcap.sourceforge.net">homepage</a></li>
	<li>jPcap by Mr. Keita Fujii: <a
		href="http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/jpcap/doc/">homepage</a>
</ul>
Both of these projects provide some kind of packet decoding facility,
but are limited on the libpcap features they expose. jNetPcap does not
provide any packet decoding facilities, but strives to expose all of the
native C libpcap library functionality in java. If you require higher
level API that is object oriented, follows java programming paradigm,
provides full packet decoding, capture file manipulation and ease of
use, see
<a href="http://jnetstream.org">jNetStream</a>
, a sister project, that is built on top of jNetPcap.
