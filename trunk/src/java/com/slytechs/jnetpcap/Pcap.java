/**
 * <P>This class is the main wrapper around libpcap and winpcap library
 * impelementations. It provides a direct mapping of various library
 * methods from Java.</P>
 * 
 * <P>Usage is very intuitive and only slightly deviates from the strict
 * "C" use since Java is object orientend language.</P>
 * 
 * <PRE style="float: right; border: double; margin-left: 1.5em;">You should read libpcap introduction on
 <A href="http://www.tcpdump.org">tcpdump.org</A> website for general overview 
 and functionality of libpcap.</PRE>
 
 Lets get started with little example on how to inquire about available interfaces, 
 ask the user to pick one of those interfaces for us, open it for capture, 
 compile and install a capture filter  and then
  start processing some packets captured as a result. This is all loosely based on 
  examples you will find on tcpdump.org website but updated for jNetPCAP.
 
 As with libpcap, we first want to find out and get network interface names so we 
 can tell jNetPCAP to open one or more for reading. So first we inquire about the 
 list of interfaces on the system:
 
 <PRE>
 PcapNetworkInterface[] interfaces = Pcap.findAllDevices();
 </PRE>
 
 Now that we have a list of devices, we we print out the list of them and ask the 
 user to pick one to open for capture:
 
 <PRE>
 for(int i = 0; i < interfaces.length; i ++) {
 	System.out.println("#" + i + ": " + interfaces[i].getName());
 }
 
 String l = System.in.readline().trim();
 Integer i = Integer.valueOf(l);
 
 PcapNetworkInterface netInterface = interfaces[i.intValue()];
 </PRE>
 
 
 Next we open up a live capture from the network interface:
 
 <PRE>
 Pcap pcap = Pcap.openLive(netInterface, 64* 1024, true);
 </PRE>
 
 First parameter is the itnerface we want to capture on, second is snaplen 
 and last is if we want the interface in promiscous mode.
 
 Once we have an open interface for capture we can apply a filter to reduce amount 
 of packets captured to something that is interesting to us:
 
 <PRE>
 PcapBpfProgram filter = pcap.compile("port 23", true, netInterface.getNetmask());
 pcap.setFilter(filter);
 </PRE>
 
 And lastly lets do something with the data.
 
 <PRE>
 
 PcapHandler handler = new PcapHandler() {
 
 	public void newPacket(PcapPacket packet, Object userData) {
 		PrintStream out = userData;
 		out.println("Packet captured on: " + packet.getHeader().getTimestamp());
 	}
 };
 
 pcap.loop(<SPAN title="Read 100 packets and exit loop">100</SPAN>, <SPAN title="our hander/callback method above">handler</SPAN>, <SPAN title="Our user object, STDOUT in our case">System.out</SPAN>);
 
 pcap.close();
 </PRE>
 
 This sets up PCAP to capture 100 packets and notify our handler of each packet as each one is captured. 
 Then after 100 packets the loop exits and we call pcap.close() to free up all the resources 
 and we can safely throw away our pcap object. Also you may be curious why we pass System.out 
 as userData to the loop handler. This is simply to demonstrate the typical usage for this kind 
 of parameter. In our case we could easily pass a different PrintStream bound to lets say a network socket 
 and our handler would produce output to it. It doesn't care.

	 * <P>Open a live capture from the network.</P>
	 * 
	 * <P>pcap_open_live() is used to obtain a packet capture descriptor to look 
	 * at packets on the network. device is a string that specifies the network 
	 * device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device argument 
	 * of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from all interfaces. snaplen 
	 * specifies the maximum number of bytes to capture. If this value is less than 
	 * the size of a packet that is captured, only the first snaplen bytes of that 
	 * packet will be captured and provided as packet data. A value of 65535 should
	 * be sufficient, on most if not all networks, to capture all the data 
	 * available from the packet. promisc specifies if the interface is to be put
	 * into promiscuous mode. (Note that even if this parameter is false, the 
	 * interface could well be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.) 
	 * For now, this doesn't work on the "any" device; if an argument of "any"
	 * or NULL is supplied, the promisc flag is ignored. to_ms specifies the read 
	 * timeout in milliseconds. The read timeout is used to arrange that the read 
	 * not necessarily return immediately when a packet is seen, but that it wait 
	 * for some amount of time to allow more packets to arrive and to read multiple 
	 * packets from the OS kernel in one operation. Not all platforms support a 
	 * read timeout; on platforms that don't, the read timeout is ignored. A zero 
	 * value for to_ms, on platforms that support a read timeout, will cause a read 
	 * to wait forever to allow enough packets to arrive, with no timeout. errbuf 
	 * is used to return error or warning text. It will be set to error text when 
	 * pcap_open_live() fails and returns NULL. errbuf may also be set to warning 
	 * text when pcap_open_live() succeds; to detect this case the caller should 
	 * store a zero-length string in errbuf before calling pcap_open_live() and 
	 * display the warning to the user if errbuf is no longer a zero-length string.</P>
