                              jNetPcap Package
                                 Change Log
== Release 1.2.rc3 (2008-12-22) ==

* Update to 1.2.rc2

* Fixes

  - #2458371 - Serious memory leak in JMemory
  
  - #2458376 - Invalid class name for an exception being thrown from JNI code
  
* Added

  - Protocol to protocol binding and registration
  
  - Protocol header annotations; makes protocol definitions much cleaner and 
    easier to write
    
  - Protocols/java directory with some - new non core protocols being released;
    Http and Html headers are included
    
  - Added several static methods to JMemory class which report on native memory
    usage for jNetPcap library; since native memory is not reported in any JRE
    statictics, the user can rely on these JMemory methods for monitoring
    native memory usage
    
  - Added several getter methods to JBuffer class that retrieve UTF8 strings in
    raw buffers
    
* Changes

  - Main JNI scanner LOOP has been slightly rewritten to take advantage of
    JHeaderScanner java objects, their bidnings and user written scanners
    
* TODO
    
  - JField class still needs more cleanup; JFieldRuntime needs to be removed
    completely
    
  - Formatting styles for field values need to be redone; currently too limited
    in functionality
    
  - Add exception hooks; exception hooks rewrite exceptions being thrown to
    include a lot more debug information that is useful when debugging a 
    protocol
   
== Release 1.2.rc2 (2008-12-06) ==

* Update to 1.2.rc1 released on 2008-11-24

* Fixed

  - Fixed PcapPacket and JPacket class APIs

  - Fixed various memory related issues found with JMemory

* Added

  - Added sub-header capabilities to JHeader and formatters

  - Added all Ip options to Ip4 header definition

  - Added all missing ICMP sub-header types
  
* Known Issues

  - TCP header definition is missing its optional sub-headers
  
  - Java binding overrides are implemented but still not fully tested
  
  - Numerous javadoc typos and blank type comments
                              
== Release 1.2 (2008-11-24) ==

* Feature release

* Added

  - #2292402 - Packet decoding framework
  
  - #2292455 - Memory management  
  
  - #2292464 - Add a function to acquire network interface MAC address
  
  - #2292515 - Simplify capturing packets in multi-threaded environment  
  
  - #2321006 - Deprecate: PcapHandler  
  
  - #2321014 - Deprecate: PcapPktHdr  
  
  - #2321017 - Deprecate: PcapInteger
  
  - #2321024 - Deprecate: certain loop, dispatch functions  

* Bugs

  - #2219738 - WinPcap.sendQueue ignores its parameter.  
               WinPcapSendQueue(int size) constructor was ignoring size 
               parameter and using a constant.
    
  - #2219729 - Memory leak in Pcap.loop().
               Memory leak in Pcap.loop method. Local JNI references were 
               accumulating causing out of memory errors in Pcap.loop when it 
               was set to loop forever.
                                 
== Release 1.1 (2008-06-19) ==

* Maintenance release

* Provides packages for: Fedora Core 8 (Linux), Debian 4 (Linux), Win32 (WinXP/Vista)

* NO BUG FIXES - no bugs reported from the time of previous release
                                 
== Release 1.0 (2007-12-21) ==

* First production release

* Bug #1855589 - Win32 isInjectSupported returned incorrect value 

== Release 1.0b4 (2007-08-21) ==

* Linux support

* Bug #1776380 - PcapBpfProgram exceptions on linux platform

* Added

  - Pcap.inject, Pcap.isSendPacketSupported, Pcap.isInjectPacketSupported,
    Pcap.lookupDev, Pcap.lookupNet
                                 
== Release 1.0b3 ==

* No bugs found or reported since previous release

* Additions to org.jnetpcap package
  
  - All core 'libpcap' functions
    
  - PcapClosedException, PcapExtensionNotAvailableException exceptions

* Addtions of and to jnetpcap.org.winpcap package - WinPcap extensions
  
    + Nearly all WinPcap based functions, very few exceptions

* Removed "commons-logging" dependency. Static initializers throw appropriate 
  exceptions directly during initialization failure.

== Release 1.0b2 ==

* Bug #1767744  - PcapHandler object ptr error in loop() and dispatch()
                  This is a critical bug, where PcapHandler objects clobers the
                  parent Pcap object data after invocation through loop() or
                  dispatch() method.
                 
* Add a number of int constants to Pcap.java class to represent various return
  codes, flags, and mode settings. Each constant has detailed explanation of
  its usage and where it is be applicable.
  
* openLive() method will now also return "warning" messages in errbuf, even if
  result code from the OK was 0, meaning no error had occured, as per pcap 
  specification.
  
* Possible issue uncovered, but not fixed in this release.

  - setting the snaplen value on openLinve() call does not seem to cause a 
    return of a truncated packet buffer from next(), nextEx(), dispatch() or 
    loop(). The buffer always contains the entire packet. Significant
    debugging effort does not point to a bug in jNetPcap software but in
    underlying WinPcap library. This could be in issue with particular Network
    Interface Card in use. The issue is still under investigation, but the fix 
    to critical bug #1767744 can not be delayed.
    
== Release 1.0b1 ==

* Initial release
