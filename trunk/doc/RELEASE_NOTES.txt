                              jNetPcap Package
                            Version 1.0b3 (beta 3)
                               Release Notes
                            Created on 2007-08-09

INTRODUCTION:
============

This release of jNetPcap library provides new features and a WinPcap extension
java package and no longer requires the inclusion of Apache's commons-logging.
The API classes are compiled with Java 1.5.X compiler and require Java 1.5 
compatibility. The package is platform dependent as there is a native library 
components supplied for each supported operating system 
(i.e. jnetpcap.dll file for win32 systems.)

This release provides the API for a complete list of Libpcap's operations which 
are to openLive, openOffline, openDead, compile filters, set them and many
others. For capturing packets, both packet at a time and dispatched handler 
methods are implemented. Also various low level kernel buffer operations that 
are natively available through WinPcap extension library are implemented as 
well, but only available on windows based platforms.

Since this is a beta release of the software the final version of the API and
functionality may change slightly by the time we reach production status. 
Feedback, peer review and feature requests are welcome. 

The javadoc API documentation  and a user guide is available at the project's 
website at:
http://jnetpcap.sourceforge.net/docs/jnetpcap-1.0b3-javadoc/index.html

== Installation Instruction ==

To install the library unzip the binary platform-dependent package into any
directory. There are 2 parts to setting up environment for jNetPcap.

  *) Win32 Dependency: jNetPcap requires WinPcap 3.1 or greater installed. 
                       WinPcap version 4.0.1 or greater is recommended, but not 
                       neccessary. (http://winpcap.org)

  1) Add supplied jnetpcap-version.jar file to your build system's CLASSPATH.
     The jar file is found at the root of the installation directory.
  
  2) Setup native jnetpcap dynamically loadable library. This varies between
     operating systems.
     
     * On Win32 systems do only one of the following
     
       - copy the jnetpcap.dll library file, found at root of jnetpcap's
         installation directory to one of the window's system folders. This
         could be \windows or \windows\system32 directory.
         
       - add the jNetPcap's installation directory to system PATH variable. This
         is the same variable used access executables and scripts.
         
       - Tell Java VM at startup exactly where to find jnetpcap.dll by setting
         a java system property 'java.library.path' such as:
           c:\> java -Djava.library.path=%JNETPCAP_HOME%
           
       - You can change working directory into the root of jnetpcap's 
         installation directory.
         
     * On unix based systems
       - add jNetPcap's installation directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
       
       - Tell Java VM at startup exactly where to find jnetpcap.dll by setting
         a java system property 'java.library.path' such as:
           shell > java -Djava.library.path=$JNETPCAP_HOME
           
       - You can change working directory into the root of jnetpcap's 
         installation directory.
         
     * For further trouble shooting information, please see the following link:
       (http://jnetpcap.wiki.sourceforge.net/Troubleshooting+native+library)

== Project Website and Support ==

The project is actively maintained at (http://jnetpcap.sourceforge.net).

Also please join project's jnetpcap-users@lists.sourceforge.net list, to discuss
the project or report bugs at (http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=164277).

== Distributed Jar Files ==

The file jnetpcap-version.jar provides the java implementation of the 
public API. The jar file will not function on its own and requires that the
supplied "native shared library" be also utilized (see below.) Without the
library, most of the classes in this jar file will throw a java 
'UnsatisfiedLinkException'.

== Distributed native shared library == 

The base directory of the distributed package contains a "native shared library"
either called 'jnetpcap.dll' on windows platforms, or 'libjnetpcap.so' on
unix based systems. The library is required in order to utilize this 
distribution. Most of the java classes included in this package will throw 
'UnsatisfiedLinkException' without this library being loaded. 

An environment variable pointing to the directory where the native library 
is located needs to be setup. This is either LD_LIBRARY_PATH on unix system, 
or PATH variable on windows systems. The library resides within the jnetpcap
installation directory. 

Within the package zip file, jnetpcap-version-arch.zip that would be 
'jnetpcap-version-arch' directory.

== Dependencies ==

 * On win32 systems
 
    - Install of WinPcap 3.1 or greater 
 
 	  + This is the main program pacakge. It installs drivers and DLLs
 	    (http://winpcap.org)
 	  
 	- No requirement for cgywin or mingw for runtime support

 * To run
 
   - Dependency removed: Apache's commons-logging library is not longer required
      
 * In addition to run supplied tests (not required)
 
   - jUnit any version
      (http://www.junit.org/index.htm)
      
 * To build from source (compiled binaries provided in package bundle)
 
   - ANT build tool for both Java and C++ sources
      (http://ant.apache.org)
      
   - Optinal ANT task for <CC> tag
      (http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/cc.html)
      
   - Win32 MinGW with GCC (doesn't require 'cgywin' or any compatibility layers)
   
   - gcc on unix

Both the jnetpcap-version.jar file and native jnetpcap library have to be 
loaded in order to use this package. The jnetpcap-version.jar file needs
to be added to CLASSPATH, while the native library to either LD_LIBRARY_PATH
on unix system, or PATH variable on windows systems.

Also if you want to run the included junit tests in the 'tests' sub directory,
you will need to included any version of 'jUnit' in the CLASSPATH.

== Operating System Notes ==

 * WinPcap OS support
 
 	- "Starting from WinPcap 4.0beta3, support for the Windows 9x/ME family of
 	  operating systems has been dropped. The last builds supporting such OSes
 	  are WinPcap 3.1 and WinPcap 4.0beta2", source http://winpcap.org website.
 	  
 	- Current version of jNetPcap has been tested with WinPcap versions 3.1, 
 	  4.0, 4.0.1
 	
 	- jNetPcap will not work with versions prior to 3.1 including 3.0 itself.
 	
 	- WinPcap extension API is only available on windows based platforms. You
 	  must use org.jnetpcap.winpcap.WinPcap.isSupport method to check if the
 	  extension is available on this particular platform, even when code was
 	  built under windows environment. The java classes are included even
 	  on platforms that don't support WinPcap extensions, but those classes and
 	  any methods inkoved will throw a PcapExtensionNotAvailableException.
 	  
 * On Linux/Freebsd

    - current release of jNetPcap does not provide support for these operating 
      systems. These operating systems are planned to be released but at a later
      timeframe.
     
    - only org.jnetpcap package is supported on all Unix based platforms.
      WinPcap extensions are disabled for non windows based platforms.
      
  * On Apple OS support 
  
    - no immediate support planned, but will release support at some point.


== General Notes ==

This is new feature release of jNetPcap. The library has been tested with
many jUnit test cases for both correct and out of bounds usage. The release's
build process does testing on the code before and after its packaged to
ensure everything is included and built with consistent environment and flags.

The beta version's of the library contain full debug information, in case any
problems are encountered and to allow troubleshooting of such problems. 
Eventual production release will have debugging information removed from default
builds suitable for deployment in commercial products.

== Bugs Fixed ==

#1770987 - Invalid flag to WinPcap.open will cause a VM crash

  * This is a WinPcap bug that is being fixed. This release of jNetPcap
    catches the condition that triggers the crash and properly handles the 
    error situation. No crashes. Bug is in "pending" status until fixed by
    WinPcap group.

== Deprecations ==

* No longer need commons-logging for logging services. All static initializer 
  error conditions throw an exception.
