/**
 * <p>
 * The real-time transport protocol (RTP). RTP provides end-to-end network
 * transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data,
 * such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network
 * services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee
 * quality-of-service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by
 * a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a
 * manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control
 * and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent
 * of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use
 * of RTP-level translators and mixers. *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that RTP itself does not provide any mechanism to ensure timely delivery
 * or provide other quality-of-service guarantees, but relies on lower-layer
 * services to do so. It does not guarantee delivery or prevent out-of-order
 * delivery, nor does it assume that the underlying network is reliable and
 * delivers packets in sequence. The sequence numbers included in RTP allow the
 * receiver to reconstruct the sender's packet sequence, but sequence numbers
 * might also be used to determine the proper location of a packet, for example
 * in video decoding, without necessarily decoding packets in sequence.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The RTP header has the following format:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  0                   1                   2                   3

 * Storage of continuous data, interactive distributed simulation, active badge,

	 * An extension mechanism is provided to allow individual implementations to
	 * experiment with new payload-format-independent functions that require
	 * additional information to be carried in the RTP data packet header. This
	 * mechanism is designed so that the header extension may be ignored by other
	 * interoperating implementations that have not been extended. Schulzrinne, et
	 * al. Standards Track [Page 18] RFC 3550 RTP July 2003 Note that this header
	 * extension is intended only for limited use. Most potential uses of this
	 * mechanism would be better done another way, using the methods described in
	 * the previous section. For example, a profile-specific extension to the
	 * fixed header is less expensive to process because it is not conditional nor
	 * in a variable location. Additional information required for a particular
	 * payload format SHOULD NOT use this header extension, but SHOULD be carried
	 * in the payload section of the packet.
	 * 
	 * <pre>

	 * 
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * If the X bit in the RTP header is one, a variable-length header extension
	 * MUST be appended to the RTP header, following the CSRC list if present. The
	 * header extension contains a 16-bit length field that counts the number of
	 * 32-bit words in the extension, excluding the four-octet extension header
	 * (therefore zero is a valid length). Only a single extension can be appended
	 * to the RTP data header. To allow multiple interoperating implementations to
	 * each experiment independently with different header extensions, or to allow
	 * a particular implementation to experiment with more than one type of header
	 * extension, the first 16 bits of the header extension are left open for
	 * distinguishing identifiers or parameters. The format of these 16 bits is to
	 * be defined by the profile specification under which the implementations are
	 * operating. This RTP specification does not define any header extensions
	 * itself.
	 * <p>
	 * This is a baseclass, suitable for use by extending it with the appropriate
	 * extension based on the profile definition. The class defines methods for
	 * reading the static fields that are present in every extension, especially
	 * the {@link #length} field. No sub-header ID needs to be manually assigned
	 * since Rtp specification only allows a single extension to exist within a
	 * header. Note that the profile specific 16-bit field has a getter method
	 * provided but is not marked with <code>Field</code> annotation. This
	 * provides a method for reading the raw 16-bit field value and allows the
	 * subclass to provide its own method that is profile specific and which
	 * possibly further breaks down the structure of this raw field into a
	 * sub-structure.

	 * The timestamp reflects the sampling instant of the first octet in the RTP

	 * jitter calculations (see Section 6.4.1). The resolution of the clock MUST
	 * be sufficient for the desired synchronization accuracy and for measuring
	 * packet arrival jitter (one tick per video frame is typically not
	 * sufficient). The clock frequency is dependent on the format of data carried
	 * as payload and is specified statically in the profile or payload format
	 * specification that defines the format, or MAY be specified dynamically for
	 * payload formats defined through non-RTP means. If RTP packets are generated
	 * periodically, the nominal sampling instant as determined from the sampling
	 * clock is to be used, not a reading of the system clock. As an example, for
	 * fixed-rate audio the timestamp clock would likely increment by one for each
	 * sampling period. If an audio application reads blocks covering 160 sampling
	 * periods from the input device, the timestamp would be increased by 160 for
	 * each such block, regardless of whether the block is transmitted in a packet
	 * or dropped as silent.
	 * </p>
	 * </p> The initial value of the timestamp SHOULD be random, as for the
	 * sequence number. Several consecutive RTP packets will have equal timestamps
	 * if they are (logically) generated at once, e.g., belong to the same video
	 * frame. Consecutive RTP packets MAY contain timestamps that are not
	 * monotonic if the data is not transmitted in the order it was sampled, as in
	 * the case of MPEG interpolated video frames. (The sequence numbers of the
	 * packets as transmitted will still be monotonic.) </p> </p> RTP timestamps
	 * from different media streams may advance at different rates and usually
	 * have independent, random offsets. Therefore, although these timestamps are
	 * sufficient to reconstruct the timing of a single stream, directly comparing
	 * RTP timestamps from different media is not effective for synchronization.
	 * Instead, for each medium the RTP timestamp is related to the sampling
	 * instant by pairing it with a timestamp from a reference clock (wallclock)
	 * that represents the time when the data corresponding to the RTP timestamp
	 * was sampled. The reference clock is shared by all media to be synchronized.
	 * The timestamp pairs are not transmitted in every data packet, but at a
	 * lower rate in RTCP SR packets as described in Section 6.4. </p> </p> The
	 * sampling instant is chosen as the point of reference for the RTP timestamp
	 * because it is known to the transmitting endpoint and has a common
	 * definition for all media, independent of encoding delays or other
	 * processing. The purpose is to allow synchronized presentation of all media
	 * sampled at the same time. </p> </p> Applications transmitting stored data
	 * rather than data sampled in real time typically use a virtual presentation
	 * timeline derived from wallclock time to determine when the next frame or
	 * other unit of each medium in the stored data should be presented. In this
	 * case, the RTP timestamp would reflect the presentation time for each unit.
	 * That is, the RTP timestamp for each unit would be related to the wallclock
	 * time at which the unit becomes current on the virtual presentation
	 * timeline. Actual presentation occurs some time later as determined by the
	 * receiver. </p> </p> An example describing live audio narration of
	 * prerecorded video illustrates the significance of choosing the sampling
	 * instant as the reference point. In this scenario, the video would be
	 * presented locally for the narrator to view and would be simultaneously
	 * transmitted using RTP. The "sampling instant" of a video frame transmitted
	 * in RTP would be established by referencing its timestamp to the wallclock
	 * time when that video frame was presented to the narrator. The sampling
	 * instant for the audio RTP packets containing the narrator's speech would be
	 * established by referencing the same wallclock time when the audio was
	 * sampled. The audio and video may even be transmitted by different hosts if
	 * the reference clocks on the two hosts are synchronized by some means such
	 * as NTP. A receiver can then synchronize presentation of the audio and video
	 * packets by relating their RTP timestamps using the timestamp pairs in RTCP
	 * SR packets. </p>
