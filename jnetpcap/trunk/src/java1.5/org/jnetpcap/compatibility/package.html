Backword compatibility package. This package provides classes that
expose, along with their supporting native libraries, API features to
older versions of jnetpcap library.
<p>A new class (lets call it class B) is created that extends the
main Pcap class (class A). Another words, class B extends class A. If we
look at Pcap class hierarchy we get:
<pre>
Pcap
 +->Pcap100
</pre>

Where Pcap is our normal Pcap class and Pcap100 is a new class that
provides libpcap 1.0.0 functions that were not available in previous
libpcap and Pcap class implementations. Both A and B classes register
and methods that correspond to the new libpcap API with JNI. The same
native jNetPcap functions service both classes. So a call from
Pcap.create is identical to a call Pcap100.create, in the sense that the
exact same native function is invoked as a wrapper around libpcap's
pcap_create call.
</p>
<p>If the user is linked to the version of jnetpcap in which the
full API is defined within the main A class, then the user does not have
to utilize class B to access those new API functions. However if class B
is utilized with an older release of jNetPcap, where the new function
calls have not been previously defined, as of release of that particular
version of jnetpcap, then class B can be used to access those new
function calls.</p>
<p>This mechanism breaks up the libpcap API into distinct layers to
which the main Pcap class is linked, while a secondary class is defined
that is backward portable to previous versions of jnetpcap.</p>
