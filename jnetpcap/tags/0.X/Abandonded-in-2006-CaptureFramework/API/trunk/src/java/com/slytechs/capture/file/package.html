<P>RO and Mutable CaptureFile framework. This package allows multi tier manipulation of capture file. The
simplest is tier allows simple RO access and some manipulation of the capture files. Use the factory methods
in CaptureFiles class to open, create new, concatenate, validate, split capture files. The main interface
at Level 1 is CaptureFile which allows some simple access to any of the supported capture file formats.</P>

<H2>Manipulation Capture Files</H2>
The capture framework allows manipulation of capture files without having to know specific format types.
<PRE>
/* Open a file for reading */
CaptureFile file;
file = CaptureFiles.openFile(new File("somefile.snoop"));

/* Concatenate two files together into a third file. The destination file is of type file1 as being the first file */
CaptureFiles.catFile(new File("destination.snoop"), new File("file1.snoop"), new File("file2.pcap"));

/* Remove any extra space or records marked for deletion from a capture file */
CaptureFiles.compactFile(new File("somefile.nap"));

/* Figure out what type of file this is, notice extensions are never used to determine file types, but headers within the file. */
System.out.println("This file type is " + CaptureFiles.typeOfFile(new File("secretfile.data")));

/*
 * Split file into individual smaller files. Nap files have descrete blocks within them, PCAP and other files are
 * simply split to 512Kb closest boundary by copying records to fit within the 512Kb boundary.
 */
CaptureFiles.splitFile(new File("somefile.nap"));

/*
 * Split file into smaller files using 1Mb blocking factor and do not try to do any compression.

CaptureFiles.splitFile(new File("somefile.pcap"), 1024 * 1024, false);

/*
 * Make sure all the fields of every record and header are valid according to the spec for the specific
 * file format. Packet contents are not checked, just file records.

<H2>Level 1 - Simplest access to any of the supported capture file formats<BR>(Skill level NOVICE)</H2>
To open an existing capture file there are two methods. First is to use the completely generic approach or use
the file specific approach.
<h3>Generic Approach</h2>
<PRE>
CaptureFile file = CaptureFiles.openFile(new File("somefile.pcap"));
System.out.println("File type is " + file.getType());
RecordIterator<PacketRecord> i = file.getPacketIterator();

PacketRecord record;
while (i.hasNext()) {
	record = i.next();
	System.out.println("Record=" + record.toString());
}
file.close();
</PRE> 

<h3>File Specific Approach</h3>
The example below opens up a PCAP file and reads the only record type it contains which
is a PacketRecord. More advanced file types may contain other types of records besides the
usual PacketRecord.
<PRE>
PCAPFile file = new PCAPFile(new File("somefile.pcap"));
System.out.println("File type is " + file.getType());

RecordIterator<PCAPPacketRecord> i = file.getPCAPPacketIterator();

PCAPPacketRecord record;
while (file.nextPacketRecord() != null) {
	System.out.println("Record=" + record.toString());
}
file.close();
</PRE>

<h3>File Specific Approach (Advanced)</h3>
Here is an example using more advanced capture file format "NAP":
<PRE>
NAPFile file = new NAPFile(new File("somefile.nap"));
System.out.println("File type is " + file.getType());

RecordIterator<NAPBlockRecord> bi = file.getNAPBLockIterator();

NAPBlockRecord block;
while (i.hasNext()) {
	block = i.next();
	
	/*
	 * Retrives the packet count field from the block header and record length
	 */
	System.out.println("packets=" + block.getPacketCount() + " size=" + block.getRecordLength() );
	
	/*
	 * Assign a custom user property within the block's meta data
	 * This property is physically stored within the NAP capture file
	 */
	block.setProperty("myProperty", "we visited the block, he he he");
	
	RecordIterator<NAPRecord> ri = block.getRecordIterator();
	NAPRecord record;
	while (ri.hasNext()) {
		record = ri.next();
		System.out.println("record type=" + record.getType() + " size=" + record.getRecordLength());
		
		/*
		 * We could also do:
		 *   ri.add(new NAPCounter("inOctets", 100000));
		 *   ri.remove();
		 *   ri.swap(ri.getFirst(), record); // shuffles the order of records
		 *   etc...
		 */
	}
}
file.close();
