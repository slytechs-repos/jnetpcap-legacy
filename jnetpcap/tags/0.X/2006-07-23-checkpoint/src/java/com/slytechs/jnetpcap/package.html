<em>jNetPCAP</em> is a complete and comprehensive Java wrapper around the popular libpcap and winpcap 
from tcpdump.org folks. jNetPCAP uses Java JNI (Java Native Interface) extensions that are platform specific 
to give access to libpcap functionality from java programs. The goal of jNetPCAP was to stick as close as possible 
to the actual libpcap API so that another API did not have to be learned. Thus its fairely easy to pickup with jNetPCAP 
and use it right away if you are familiar with existing "C" counter part libpcap and winpcap libraries.</P>

<P>This document describes the usage, implementation details and few differences between jNetPCAP and back end 
libpcap implementations. Java is after all OOPL (Object Oriented Programming Language). There are also few 
differences between primitive types which are all explained here.</P>

<P>I will skip general introduction to jNetPCAP functionality since its 100% mapped between libpcap, so please 
feel free to to read libpcap documentation at <A href="http://tcpdump.org">tcpdump.org</A>. You can visit the 
project website for for more information and a user guide with tutorials at <A href="http://jnetstream.sf.net/q=jNetPCAP">http://jnetstream.sf.net</A>.</P>
