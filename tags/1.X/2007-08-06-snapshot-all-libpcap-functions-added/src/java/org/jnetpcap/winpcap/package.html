<p>WinPcap extensions to libpcap. This package adds additional
functionality provided by WinPcap library widely available on win32
based platforms. These extensions are optional and are not available on
unix based platforms.</p>
<h1>Checking for WinPcap extension availability</h1>
Before you utilize any of the extension in this package, the programmer
must first check if the extensions are available on this particular
platform. To do that use
<code>WinPcap.isSupported()</code>
method which returns a boolean value. A return value of
<code>true</code>
means that the extensions are supported and available, while a value of
<code>false</code>
means they are not. All methods will throw an
<code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>
if used and the extensions are not supported on this particular
platform. Therefore it is essential to always perform this check before
relying on these extensions.
