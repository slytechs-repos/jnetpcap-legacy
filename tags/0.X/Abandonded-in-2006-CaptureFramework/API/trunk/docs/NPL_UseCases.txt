The following use case document references the file header structure specified
in NAP_Header_formats.txt document. In summary the document lists the following
types if headers:

*) BlockRecord  - Also called in other format the FileHeader or the main header
                  that appears at the beginning of a capture file.

*) PacketRecord - A record that contains PACKET data as array of bytes. It also
                  contains small amount of meta information such as first protocol
                  or linktype and capture timestamp of when the capture of the packet
                  took place.

*) MetaRecord   - A record containing additional information about the overall capture
                  file, block and individual records.

*) NoOpRecord   - A record that can take up space. This type of record can be used
                  to allocate empty space for future use. Other records can be easily
                  turned into a NoOpRecord by changing a 4 bit value of record type
                  field, effectively being removed.
