<P>Access to capture files. This package provides low level access to capture files.
Currently NAP, PCAP and SNOOP formats are supported. This package has been designed
to access all available information contained in these capture files including any META
data. Or if you don't need that level of detail, you can just simply iterate and do operations
on the files.</P>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<P>The main method for opening a capture file is CaptureFile.open(File file). It will return
appropriate instance of a CaptureFile abstract class which with the file open and ready for
various operations on it.</P>

<P>You can use collections views to manipulate and access capture file content. You can use 3 getters
to get mutable views of the capture file:
<UL>
 <LI> getBlockRecords(): List<BlockRecord> </LI>
 Retrieves a list of top level block records. For PCAP and SNOOP there is only 1 block record.
 For NAP capture files there could be many block records.
 <LI> getDataRecords(): List<DataRecord> </LI>
 A list of all the data records independent of the blocks they are contained in, but in proper sequence.
 Any data records that are out of seqeunces are mapped to be in sequence.
 <LI> getPacketRecords(): List<PacketRecord> </LI>
 A list of all the packet records, records containing packet data. All non packet records, usually contain
 meta information, are skipped. The packet records are returned in the proper sequence even if they occure
 out of sequence.
 <LI> getAllRecords(): List<Record></LI>
 Returns a list of all records in the order they appear in the capture file, not neccessarily in their proper
 order.
</UL>
<P>The collections are marely views and do not prefetch all of the data. This means that delays while elements
of the collections are being accessed while the actual data is loaded from the capture file. Also the returned 
collections views are fully mutable which means you can add and remove records and the underlying
capture file will be properly updated. For PCAP and SNOOP formats this may mean that a new copy of the original
file may be created and modifications applied to it. For NAP capture files the modifications can be done in place
without file copies.<P> 
<P>Care must be taken when modifying a collection which hides the meta records or with the block record which is a container
for a large number of data records. If a Data record or packet record is removed, care must be taken to remove any meta records
that may have preceded the data or packet record.</P>
<P>Also note that views returned are inter-dependent and changing one may change another view. For example when
inserting a record into a block may mean that a new block is created as a result and if previously returned, the
List<BlockRecord> collection will be modified.</P>

<h3>Mutable behaviour and notification</h3>
<P>You can monitor the state of the capture file and be notified when its modified. This is especially useful 
when using collections views of the capture file. Since the views do not notify that they have been changed
you need to use this mechanism to monitor changes to capture file and its views.</P>
